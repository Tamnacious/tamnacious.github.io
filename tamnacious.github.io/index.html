            Experiencing a whole semester away from home was quite different but </br>
             it was also very unique. I was able to gain more knowledge</br>
              here than I would've back at home. I was also lucky enough to attend classes </br>
             such as recitations and seminars that help improve my learning </br>
             experience especially since not all colleges have similar programs. As an aspiring</br>
              computer engineer, classes here are able to pick out my weaknesses and </br>
              strengths to help develop my choices and future.</font>

              Throughout the semester, I was able to learn a variety of internet related topics. </br>
              I also gained knowledge in video editing, website making, and many tricks to the internet. </br>
              Here are some of the videos I made to teach viewers some topics of the web:
