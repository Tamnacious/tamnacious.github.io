   <h1>Who am I?</h1>

	     <p>Hello, my name is Carmen Tam and I'm from Queens, NY.
          I'm an aspiring Computer Engineering major currently enrolled
          at the University at Buffalo reason being that I enjoy the logical
          structure of coding as well as the hands-on experience I gain with
          the actual construction of the powerful mind that works within a computer
          that many people use today.
